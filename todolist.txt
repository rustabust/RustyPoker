* wishing i had started this todo list earlier. cannot figure out what i was doing on the evaluatorrefactor branch...
* seems i left off writing tests for hand description...
* ...but seems pokerhand and handevaluator are not completely in sync yet
* ...in order to report the description of the hand, the hand evaluator needs to keep track of which 5 out of the 7 input cards are the best / actual hand 
* stopping now. moved evaluator into pokerhand class. functions need to be non-staticized and refer to local cards variables, track best hand
